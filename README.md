# MNIST-Classification-Using-Neural-Network
This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark in machine learning, consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9). This model leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying these digits. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics to assess performance. Ideal for learning and experimenting with fundamental neural network concepts.
